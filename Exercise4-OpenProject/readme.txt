Libraries can be accessed at corresponding home pages, or at TUM Game Physics Template repository. Due to sheer scale of these libraries, they are not added to this sub-repository. Nevertheless, project compilation will fail without proper setup of these components. Refer to the TUM Game Physics repository and provided exercise pdf for further details.
